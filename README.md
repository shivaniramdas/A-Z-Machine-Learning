# Machine Learning

> I have been working towards revising and building on some old concepts related to Machine Learning. Here is a synopsis of the topics I am touching upon:

1. Identify the problem:

       a. Based on human intervention - Supervised / Unsupervised / Semi-supervised / Reinforcemnet learning
       b. Capability to learn on the fly - Batch(offline) / Online
       c. Generalisation - instance based / model based
       d. Regression / Classification problem
       e. Univariate / Multivariate
       
2. Choose performance measures

       - Regression - RMSE(l2,eucladian,sentitive to outliers) / MAE(l1,manhattan,best outliers present)
       - Classification - Accuracy using CV, confusion matrix, precision-recall curve, roc curve
       
California Housing Dataset - 

- Data problems: Insufficiency/ Non-representativeness/ Poor Quality/ Feature relevancy
- Transformation Pipelines
- Model Training
- Evaluation using cross Validation/ Grid Search/ Randomised Search

MNIST Handwriting recognition Dataset- 

- Binary classification
- Multiclass / Multinomial classification
- Multilabel classification
- Multioutput classification : Cleaning images of noise
- Performance Measures
- Error Analysis
